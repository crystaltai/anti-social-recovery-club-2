# Anti Social Recovery

You're the owner of a smart contract but you lost the key. You're screwed‚Ä¶. Or are you? Anti Social Recovery is a design pattern that enables users to recover ownership of their smart contract - without relying on their lost signing keys.

### Built for ETHGlobal New York 2023 Hackathon.

## Project Idea: What if contracts were owned by humans instead of addresses?

### Anti Social Recovery allows users to create smart contracts where the ownership of that smart contract is tied to the user's unique proof-of-personhood (e.g., their World ID).

We've implemented World ID verification in our app, which enables users to deploy a contract as the owner. The user can then use a different EOA, re-verify with World ID, and take over ownership of the same contract.

### Actions supported:

- Sign in with wallet
- Verify unique proof-of-personhood with [Worldcoin](https://twitter.com/worldcoin) World ID
- Deploy a smart contract where the proof-of-personhood serves as an input to prove ownership
- Claim rightful ownership of a smart contract owned by a human, not just an address
